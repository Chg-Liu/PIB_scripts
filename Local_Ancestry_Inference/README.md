# RFMix (local ancestry inference)

We used slurm*.cmd for running RFMix with reference panels of East Asian, Near Ocenaic ancestires.  
slurm2.cmd has been used for additionally running RFmix on Island Southeast Asian populations.  
slurm3.cmd has been used for running RFMix with populations grouped. Those populations were grouped in other analysis due to limited sample sizes.    
We used the results of grouped populations for the subsequent analysis.
