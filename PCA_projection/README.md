# PCA archaic projection

In this analysis, we generated a PC space by using genomes of (Altai Neaderthal, Denisovan and Chimpanzee) and (Vindija, Neanderthal and Chimpanzee). Then we projected Pacific Islander populations onto the plane generated by the first two PCs.

We used [cmd*.sh] to run smartpca for this analysis. 

[par*.txt] contains all parameters in which [poplist*.txt] listed the names of populations used for generating the PC space.
